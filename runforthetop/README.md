This is an experimental mini-game.

The player may move none, one, or both their units during their turn.

The goal of the game is to move both units above row 3.  Of course, the best strategy is to always move all your units north, and the first player always wins.  This is not meant to be an interesting game to play, it's just a stepping stone for me to understand how to implement games in this framework.

And to understand how to implement a game where a player may perform more than one action per turn.
